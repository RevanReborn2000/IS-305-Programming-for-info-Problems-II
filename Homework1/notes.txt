A big Thank you to Professor Wickes' Pokemon file provided in the week four module. I drew heavy inspiration from it.
Everything else was done from memory. I was able to rely on prior Knowledge. I did google for unzipping files at https://appdividend.com/2020/10/19/how-to-unzip-list-of-tuples-in-python/ then remember I did not need this operation in my code. Thanks.
